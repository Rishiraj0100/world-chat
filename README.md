# World Chat!

Hi! World chat is a discord bot that enables users to talk to new people across different servers without actually joining any other server.
World-chat is made with `Python` using `discord.py` by [`deadshot#7999`](https://discord.gg/aBM5xz6).

## Running

I would prefer if you don't host your instance of my bot however you are allowed host your instance , just please don't expect much support if you run into some errors (which you probably will).

Nevertheless , Installation steps are as follows:
- **Make sure you have python 3.5 or higher.**.
- [Optional] Setup virual environment.
- Install all the dependencies: 
	1. for linux: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
	2. for win: `pip instalal -r requirements.txt`.
- Create database in PostgreSQL.
- Rename `example_config.py` to `config.py` and paste your discord token and stuff.

##  Note:
I don't actively work on world-chat and that is the reason I am making it open-source. If you find any bugs (you probably will) , you are welcome to open pull-requests, 
Also , please don't send me any feature requests , instead write them on your own and send me a pull-request.
