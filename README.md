# World Chat!

Hi! World chat is a discord bot that enables users to talk to new people across different servers without actually joining any other server.
World-chat is made with `Python` using `discord.py` by [`deadshot#7999`](https://discord.gg/aBM5xz6).

## Running

I would prefer if you don't host your instance of my bot however you are allowed host your instance , just please don't expect much support if you run into some errors (which you probably will). **The source here is provided for educational purposes only.**

Nevertheless , Installation steps are as follows:

- **Make sure you have python 3.5 or higher.**.
- [Optional] Setup virual environment.
- Install all the dependencies:
  1.  for linux: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
  2.  for win: `pip instalal -r requirements.txt`.
- Create database in PostgreSQL.
- Rename `example_config.py` to `config.py` and paste your discord token and stuff.

## Disclaimer:

You can independently host your instance of world-chat to test or talk with friends or just to have fun. The source here is provided for educational purposes only.
REMEMBER: **DON'T CLAIM THE CODE TO BE YOURS IF YOU HOST A PUBLIC INSTANCE. AND OBVIOUSLY DON'T PUBLISH YOUR INSTANCE TO TOPGG. LOL**
